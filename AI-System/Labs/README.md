# Labs

The labs consist of basic labs and advanced labs. In this session, we designed experimental courses from the perspective of system research. 

Encourage students to implement and optimize system modules by operating and applying mainstream and latest frameworks, platforms and tools to improve their ability to solve practical problems, not just understanding the use of tools.

## Target users

* Junior and Senior students in colleges
* Graduate students

## Experimental design goals

This experimental course is designed from the perspective of system research. Through the operation and application of mainstream and latest frameworks, platforms and tools, students are encouraged to implement and optimize system modules to improve their ability to solve practical problems, rather than just understanding the use of tools.

## Experimental design features

1. Provide a unified framework, platform and tools.
   
2. Design an operable experiments content.
   
3. The experiment content of universal design is convenient to deepen and improve according to the characteristics of the universities.
   
4. Get started with practical engineering projects and deepen the understanding of AI systems.
